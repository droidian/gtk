<title>Filing a bug report or feature request</title>

<para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in GTK, please
file a bug report on <ulink url="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues">GitLab</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Don't hesitate to file a bug report, even if you think we may know
about it already, or aren't sure of the details. Just give us as much
information as you have, and if it's already fixed or has already been
discussed, we'll add a note to that effect in the report.
</para>

<para>
The bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests, it's
not only for bugs. We track all GTK development in GitLab, so it's
the way to be sure the GTK developers won't forget about an issue.
</para>

<para>
Just make sure that any issue filed is actionable, and contains clear
instructions on how to reproduce an issue, and the conditions to close
the bug report or feature request. Non-actionable, or user support
questions will be directed to Discourse.
